Updated repository for Payara Dockerfiles. Each version has a Full profile, Web profile and Micro edition.

Payara is located in the /opt/payara41 directory. This is deliberately free of any versioning so that any scripts written to work with one version can be seamlessly migrated to the latest docker image.
